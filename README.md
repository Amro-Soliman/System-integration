# System-integration
-----------------------

This Project is about system integration with third party system, in my case [Books library API].
In this application a user can upload a CSV [ONLY CSV FILES ARE ACCEPTED] file with ISBN of a book or books, 
the next step is that uploaded CSV file is going to be sent to the earlier mentioned Books library API, 
and get informations on the books that matches the ISBN numbers in the uploaded file.
After returning the matching books, the client must provide a valid bank card number, expiry date and CVC number,
in order to be able to get the Download link after successful payment.
